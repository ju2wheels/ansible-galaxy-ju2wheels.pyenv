# Remove pyenv build dependencies
# WARNING: Please ensure to reduce the default package list as well depending on whether you are running this in a container, server,
#          or desktop install so you dont accidentally remove packages that are required by desktop packages for example.
#          Its recommended to reduce the package list to only uninstall the development libraries if you are unsure (see unit tests).
